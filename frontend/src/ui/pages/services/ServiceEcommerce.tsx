					<h3>Complete E‑Commerce Services - From China to U.S.</h3>
					<p>We can consolidate shipments in China for merchants who would like to create a great buyer's experience for their customers in the U.S. We ship the goods to the U.S., transfer them to our warehouse and make sure they meet all packing standards. Then we deliver the goods to Amazon's warehouse if FBA service is required, or dispatch to the end user directly by USPS, UPS or FedEx.</p>
					<h3>Multi‑Channel Inventory</h3>
					<p>Our multi‑channel inventory system connects to top e‑commerce platforms and allows merchants direct access to their inventory in our warehouse and follow up on their orders.</p>
					<h3>From U.S. to China</h3>
					<p>As a freight forwarder, we can arrange E‑Commerce shipments from the U.S. to China by Air or Sea.</p>
